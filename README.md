Let-me introduce myself. My name is **Gabriel Witor** and my close relation with computers started as a kid, when i would spend countless hours tinkering and tweaking things on my computer. My first contact with code was when i was around 11 years old, when I got into minecraft mods and plugins to create servers. Now I'm 20 years old, and I'm persuing my dream to become a software developer! :)

In this page you'll find some of my projects. I'm really passionate about learning everything technology related, including but not limited to: General software development, machine learning, operating systems, servers, databases and security.
